## Untitled game

Untitled game is a cross between the turn-based, battlefield-style gameplay of [Final Fantast Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics) (FFT) and the Boost and Break mechanics of [Octopath Traveler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler) (OT).
The battlefield in FFT allows the execution of creative offensives via strategic placement of units.
From OT, units can augment attacks and abilities using boost points and can render enemy units stunned and vulnerable ("break") by targeting enemy weaknesses.

Both games feature a rich set of job classes and abilities, providing many creative combinations of army types.
The player is rewarded for effectively managing the dynamic interaction between units and their jobs to help expose the enemies weak points and take down the opposing army.

My central purpose in developing this project has been to get a glimpse of video game development and to learn [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) (and consequently up my Python and general programming skills).
I hope to make a fun two-player game that is easy to learn but also challenging for seasoned players.
